# TODOs:
* Change colorscheme from outside config repo.
* Tmux and vim colerschemes move in lockstep.
* Spell check comments.

# Restructure
`config` will contain dotfiles and general terminal setup on macos. (This includes installing neovim)
Move nvim folder to its own repo
`config` will clone `nvim` repo and copy config files to correct location.
`config` will clone `repos` repo and perform that setup as well.
