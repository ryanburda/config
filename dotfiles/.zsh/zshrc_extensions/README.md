# ZSHRC Extensions
Add executable files to this directory to have them run at the end of your `.zshrc`.

This is useful for adding specific scripts that are only used on certain computers like your work laptop.
This directory is added to the `.gitignore` to encourage scripts to be symlinked in from other repos.
