# Tmux Scripts
* script up what your ideal set of windows and panes is per session for Data Engineering work.
    - This will result in one project per session
    - The script should accept a path to where the project lives
    - This means there will be one generic tmux script and one script per project.
    - Optional per project setup work can be done in the project specific script after the tmux script has been called.
    - have the tmux server automatically create all of these sessions as well as an empty session.
* copy mode select and copy text to clipboard
