The Vimium Chrome extension allows for custom key mappings.
This can be used to have the keys used for cycling through buffers in Vim map to the same keys
used to cycle through tabs in Chrome.

```
# Insert your preferred key mappings here.
unmap <space>
map <space>h previousTab
map <space>l nextTab
map <space>j goBack
map <space>k goForward
map <space>t createTab
map <space>x removeTab
map <space>X restoreTab
```
